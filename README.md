🚀 Scott Lingner's Solo Bookmark App for Thinkful's Software Engineering Immersion 🚀

### As a user: ###

#### I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

    - [x]title
    - [x]url link
    - [x]description
    - [x]rating (1-5)

#### I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

    - [x]All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

#### I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

    - [x]Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

#### I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

#### I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

    - [x]Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
#### I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection ####
